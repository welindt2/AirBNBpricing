This project analyzes pricing dynamics in the short-term rental market using data from 6,272 Airbnb listings across five major US metropolitan areas (NYC, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami). 
The analysis employs both Bayesian hierarchical modeling and XGBoost machine learning to understand pricing drivers and develop predictive models for revenue optimization.

There are 3 files:
1. The analysis file (AirbnbPricing.Rmd)
2. The report generating file (Airbnb-markdown.Rmd); and,
3. The PDF from that markdown file.
